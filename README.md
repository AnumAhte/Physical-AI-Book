# AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This project aims to develop an AI-native textbook focused on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It integrates a RAG chatbot for interactive learning and follows a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. The content covers various aspects from foundational concepts to advanced topics like Vision-Language-Action Systems and a Capstone project on Autonomous Humanoid development.

## Project Structure
- `/docs`: Markdown chapters and associated assets.
- `/backend`: FastAPI server for RAG chatbot and other backend services.
- `/src`: Docusaurus React components for the frontend.
- `/specs`: Specification, plan, and task documents (SDD artifacts).
- `/.specify`: Spec-Kit Plus memory and templates.
- `/.claude`: Claude Code commands for chatbot integration.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Docusaurus 3 (React)
- Backend: FastAPI, Qdrant (vector DB), Cohere
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Getting Started
