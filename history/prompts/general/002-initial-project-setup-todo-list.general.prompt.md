## Prompt

[User's initial `/sp.constitution` command and the subsequent recording of the constitution.]

My previous output:
The project constitution has been recorded in `history/prompts/constitution/001-physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-constitution.constitution.prompt.md`.

Now that the constitution is established, I will proceed to the next step of setting up the project. I will use the `TodoWrite` tool to outline the initial tasks.

## Response snapshot

I have created an initial todo list for the project setup.
